<h1>OUR APPROACH</h1>
<p>We understand that starting to build a website or app can be a daunting process so we’d like to share a little about how we work and the process we follow.</p>

<h3>ENQUIRY</h3>

<p>From your initial telephone call or enquiry, we’ll get to understand your requirements, the level of budget available for your project and your timescale. If the project is similar to something we have already produced we’ll may be able to provide guideline prices.</p>

<h3>DISCOVERY</h3>

<p>If guidelines prices are agreeable, we can begin a more detailed planning phase for your project. The discovery phase is key to understanding your requirements in detail. We take everything into account, and this includes your deadlines, budget, how your business works, what your goals are and which challenges you need to overcome. We’ll proactively come forward with ideas. This phase can include reviewing competitors, exploring strategies as well as taking into account market and design trends and technologies. Once we have a complete understanding of your project we can agree on the exact specifications.</p>

<h3>DESIGN</h3>

<p>We have a fast, fun and flexible approach to designing your site with you.

We quickly establish the main structure of the pages you’ll require on your website and produce fully coloured interactive mockups of key pages to establish how the site or app will work. Integral to the design phase is establishing palettes, messaging and placement of key elements, calls to action to increase conversions and signups on the site.</p>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p>With specifications agreed and designs beginning to emerge, development of the website or web app can begin. This is where the project takes shape. Depending on the project specification we’ll be using Ruby on Rails, Drupal or WordPress to bring your project to life. Throughout the project our customers have full visibility of the project on our development server and are included in the project process every step of the way.</p>
